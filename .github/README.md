## Instructions to run tests

1. `NODE_ENV=development npm ci`
2. `cp .env.example .env`, update its values
3. `npm run test` to test the code

## Instruction to run in development mode

1. `NODE_ENV=development npm ci`
2. `cp .env.example .env`, update its values
3. `npm run start:dev`

### hash table advantage

It allows me to break a large problem input set into separated problem's with less input.
Mathematically, technically, asymptotically **It's worst case performance is O(n)**, but in real world this is not true, because your input decreased. So we can say that it is more faster than a linear search.
