# Factory Method

- AKA Virtual Constructor.
- An interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Have a common interface that subclasses implements and superclass enforces subclasses to implement it. Though ech subclass implement it tailored to its needs while complying with the general rules.
- [Client](../README.md#glossaryClient) does not care about the implementation details. All it knows is that which properties/methods/getters/setters are available.
- [Learn more](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method`).

> [!TIP]
>
> If there are too many [product](../README.md#glossaryProduct) types and it doesnâ€™t make sense to create subclasses for all of them, you can reuse the control parameter from the base class in subclasses.
>
> Look at [this example](./logistic-example.ts).

## Why do we need it?

| Reason                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                              |

| To not violate open-close principle of SOLID(Ease of extension).                 | `createNotification` or `createTransport` should not change because we have new means of transportation or sending notification                                      |
| To not violate single responsibility principle of SOLID(Separation of concerns). | `createNotification` or `createTransport` should only create a new transport/notification and not extra code that are not directly related to single responsibility. |

        When someone requests a connection, the program should
        look for a free ones inside that pool. Then return it
        to the client code. If there are no free objects, the
        program should create a new one (and add it to the pool).
