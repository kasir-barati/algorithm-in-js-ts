# Binary tree

A data structure, similar to a linked list but different in one key way:

-   In a linked list we have list element, then we link that element to another element in the linked list (They're chained together).
-   Instead of linking one element to another we link them to potentially two element; a left and a right.
    -   Left: contains values that are smaller
    -   Right: contains values that are larger

Because of that difference it is more efficient to insert and search in a binary tree, compare to a linked list.

> If your Binary tree is not a balanced binary tree you're not gonna experience any form of efficiency. You need to have a balanced binary search tree for that.
